# Blackjack
Designed and developed an educational Blackjack simulation focused on probability, risk management, and decision-making rather than gambling outcomes. The game emphasizes responsible behavior by limiting reckless play, tracking user decisions, and highlighting how small statistical disadvantages compound over time. Through this project, I explored concepts central to finance such as expected value, variance, and long-term risk, while also addressing the psychological side of gambling and addiction. The project was intentionally framed as anti-gambling, aiming to promote financial discipline, informed decision-making, and healthy spending habits. Building the game strengthened my programming skills in C++ and reinforced my interest in applying analytical thinking and ethical considerations to financial systems and markets.
